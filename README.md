### **Guess the Number Game**

This is a simple "Guess the Number" game built using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It is designed to help in learning **DOM Manipulation** and **Event Handling** in JavaScript while creating an interactive web application. The game features a user-friendly interface with modern design elements powered by **Tailwind CSS**, along with a smooth gameplay experience.

#### **Features:**

- **User Input**: Users enter a guess between 1 and 100.
- **Random Number**: The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, which the player has to guess.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Chances Tracking**: The player has a limited number of chances (10), and each wrong guess decreases the chances.
- **Score System**: The player earns points for each correct guess, and consecutive correct guesses will reward extra chances.
- **Game Reset**: The game can be reset after a win or loss to allow for another round of play.
- **Game Rules**: A modal displays the game rules before the player begins.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
  
#### **Learning Outcomes:**

This project helps improve your understanding of the following concepts:
- **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**: Interacting with and updating HTML elements dynamically.
- **JavaScript Event Handling**: Managing user input events, such as button clicks and form submissions.
- **Conditionals and Loops**: Using `if` statements and loops to check conditions (correct guess, chances remaining, etc.).
- **Game Logic**: Implementing game mechanics and user interaction logic, like checking guesses, updating scores, and resetting the game state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling the project with the Tailwind CSS framework for a modern and responsive design.

#### **How to Play:**
1. **Start the Game**: Click the "Start Game" button after reading the rules.
2. **Guess**: Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the input box and click "Submit Guess".
3. **Feedback**: The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low. You will get a message if you guess the number correctly.
4. **Chances**: You have 10 chances to guess the number. Each wrong guess will reduce the chances.
5. **Winning**: If you guess the number correctly, your score increases, and the game will reset.
6. **Game Over**: The game ends when you run out of chances, and the correct number will be revealed.

#### **Technologies Used:**
- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the game page.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, DOM manipulation, event handling, and score management.
